Advent of Code is a series of puzzles over 25 days, each with a part 1 and
part 2. The difficulty roughly rises each day, with the later puzzles often
requiring some tricky algorithms to solve.

For these solutions, the various days are in separate directories, with a
separate file for each part. Day 25, as traditional, is only a single part.

These solutions for 2021 aren't as cleaned up and well documented as other years I've done,
so apologies in advance for some unused code left in, lack of comments or other lack
of professionalism. I didn't expect to post these solutions, but other years I more decided
to publically post those, and those are better documented as I wrote them.
